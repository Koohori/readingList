# An Invitation to Philosophy

- Definition
	- love of wisdom
	- rigorous attempt to understand
	- persistent and organized attempt to see life steadily and see it whole
- Fields of Philosophy
	- Epistemology - how do we know? 
	- Metaphysics - what is real?
	- Axiology / values - what is good, right or beautiful?
- Two approaches to philosophy
	- historical 
		- usually studied in chronological order
		- contributions of acknowledged philosophers
	- issue
		- start with issues or questions
		- based on conviction that interest in philosphy inquiry can be excited more readily at the very outset 
- Two kinds of philosophy
	- Critical 
		- analyze statements and identify precise meaning or mutural relations among concepts
		- proceed beyond fuzzy meanings or unreliable knowledge
		- language must be precise and clear
	- Speculative
		- endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experiences can be interpreted 
		- most Western philosophers
- Inductive reasoning
	- process of drawing conclusions from specific evidence
	- conclusions are typically drawn from observation of particular caes
	- such as 'first grape in this bunch tasted sour (premise), second grape in this bunch tasted sour (premise), third grape in this bunch tastes sour (premise), hence next grape in this bunch will also taste sour (conclusion)
- Deductive reasoning
	- widespread agreement on definitions of basic concepts or rules
	- such as 'all humans being are mortal (premise), Socrates is a human being (premise), Therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion)'
	- typically analytic
- Informal Fallacies - When there is an error in logical reasoning
	- Amphiboly (Syntactical ambiguity)
		- form of confustion that results when grammatical construction of a stement makes the meaning unclear
		- 'Archivists examined an original flag that had led Union solders into battle at the Civil War Library in Philadelphia'
		- grammer is confusing. Whether the flag was examined at the library or the soldiers battled at the Library
	- Sementical Ambuiguity
		- form of confution that results when a word or phrase can have two or more different meanings
		- 'Trustees asked secruity personnel to stop drinking on campus'
		- grammer is confusing. Whether sking security guards themselves to avoid drinking or to stop others from drinking
	- Equivocation
		- form of semantical ambiguity
		- Establishing a conclusion by using a word in two different senses in the same argument
		- 'Anyone who is considered old enough to join the army and fight for his country is a mature person; and anyone who votes must be mature too. So, anyone mature enough to fight is mature enough to vote.'
		- term 'mature' means two diferent things
	- Post hoc fallacy
		- incorrect assumption that merely because two events occur together or in a time sequence
		- 'Evelyn carried a rabbit's foot, so naturally she won the race'
		- argument misses other factors that may have contributed to Evelyn winning the race
	- False dilemma
		- assumption is improperly made that an issue has only two sides or that there are only two alternative choices in a situation
		- People are either Christians or atheists
		- What about other religions?
	- Argumentum ad hominem
		- faulty assumption that if you discredit the person, you therby discredit his or her argument
		- 'What can he know about patriotism? He speaks with a foreign accent'
		- How does someone's level of patriotism correlate with their accent?
	- Begging the question
		- We beg the question when the argument is based on the very conclusion we are trying prove
		- Argument merely moves in a circle and says the same thing twice
		- 'Learning is important because everyone should acquire knowledge'
		- repeating the same thing does not prove a point
	- Hypothesis contrary to fact
		- very questionable claim that one can know eith certainty what would have happened if a past event or condition had been different then what actually happened
		- 'If my father had been rich, I would be a successful surgeon today'
	- Straw man
		- misrepresenting a statement or an argument, or substituing another one, in order to attack the original statement or argument more easily
		- 'Go ahead and build your nuclear power plant. I guess you don't care about the environment'
		- Categorizing incorrectly and alternatively punishing an argument that was not made about that caring of the environment
	- False obversion
		- miuse of contrasts and opposites
		- Children learn easily; therefore, adults learn with difficulty'
		- Just because adults are opposite of children, does not mean they learn slower automatically
	- Tesimonial
		- strategy of directing attention to a well-known or attractive person in order to create a positive image
		- 'I always buy Bulgarian motor cars because on TV my favorite movie star says they are well made'
		- creating impression through a celebrity does not logically prove an argument
	- Bandwagon:
		- appealing to common practice in order to get others to do something or to share a same point of view
		- 'Chew Bozo Bubble Gum - ten million people can't be wrong'
		- more people believing something or doing activities does not mean they are intrinsically correct
	- Reification
		- practice of treating a word or a concept as if it were a thing with life or power of its own
		- 'Science will turn all of into robots'
		- gives a personalized life and power to what is usually regarded as a collective concept
		- makes an object or a foce out of something that is usually general or abstract
		- Science does not do anything - Scientists do.
